**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

Artemis Financial is a financil consulting company that has tasked us with aiding them in modernizing their operations. Because they are a financial institution, heavy emphasis on security has been placed on development.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

I believe the thing that I did best in development is the inclusion of hash functionality. Secure code development is highly important as it non secure code opens the system and the customer up to additional opportunities for attacks. As software developers, we have a responsibility to deliver on a system that not only meets the requirements of the customer, but does so in a way that prioritizes the wellbeing of the customer and any potential users. Software that is secure helps put the minds of the customers/users at ease. No one wants to use a system with the threat of potential security issues looming over their heads. Devlivering on a secure system comes with the added benefit of peace of mind. 

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

As most of what we did in the class was new to me, I found reading and understanding the Maven Dependency reports to be quite difficult. While I am still not sure I fully understand, I definitely am in a much better position now than I was going into this class. 

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

When it came to increasing security, the inclusion of a hash algorithm using SHA-256 that is asymmetrical provided, what I believe, to be the best means of security to Artemis Financial that I could deliver. Implementing similar, multi-layered levels of protection in conjunction to dependency reports that we learned of in this class will be a great way to improve my own abilities to deliver on secure systems with the cusomers and users best interests in mind. 

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

Testing each piece of code was the first step I took. After that, integration testing to the best of my abilities was used to ensure that, when together, everything functioned as intended. Additional vulnerability testing was done throughout and again at the end of development to ensure that not additional vulnerabilities were introduced. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

I relied on, as a have for a few classes now, stackoverflow for development. Reading through posts from others who have had similar issues or knowledge to share over topics related to my work has helped me gain a better understanding of aspects of assignments that I may not have truly understood previously. I will likely continue to read through similar exchanges online to better my own knowledge on subjects relevant to my work. 

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I would begin with the ability to generate vulnerability reports and interpret those reports into something more digestible to individuals not in this line of work. From there, I would explain or demonstrate the ability to code in a secure manner and/or intruduce additional means of security to a system.
